# Solidarity - the game (working title)

This is an open source browser MMORPG.

The players live in a cyberpunk dystopia, but slowly discover and build alternatives to wageslave life/a solidarity economy.

## Contributing

If you want to help developing, just write an e-mail to b3yond@riseup.net.
I probably won't have time for this before November 2017, but if I can already collect names & e-mail adresses, that would help a lot.

If you have feedback, ideas, criticism, please open an issue :) it is highly appreciated!

## Engine

We have not decided on an engine yet. There are several candidates which could work:

* http://www.turbulenz.biz/
* https://github.com/WhitestormJS/whs.js
